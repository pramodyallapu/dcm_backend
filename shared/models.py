    Row-level tenant isolation: every tenant-scoped model gets an
    `organization` FK plus a manager (`objects`) that auto-filters every
    query to the current tenant (see shared/tenancy.py). `all_organizations`
    is the explicit, opt-in bypass for legitimate cross-tenant code
    (Django admin, the TPMS sync command) — it is never the default.

    Subclasses whose organization is unambiguously derivable from a parent
    FK (e.g. Target.program) should override `_derive_organization_id()` to
    return that parent's organization_id instead of relying on the ambient
    context — this makes a cross-organization mismatch structurally
    impossible for that field rather than merely checked. Every subclass
    should also set `_org_scoped_fk_fields` to the list of FK field names
    that must belong to the same organization as this row; `save()`
    validates all of them.
